#Project Description
The project my team and I built is an Adventure Quest interactive, dynamic experience that included click-through quests as well as open-world character navigation in a two-dimensional space. While similar games or experiences follow a more linear direction of game/character development, we designed our Adventure Quest with an emphasis on surprise and high re-playability. The choices a user makes will not only affect future outcomes of upcoming quests, but those outcomes themselves can change upon a second playthrough even if other factors such as previous choices and character attribute points remain constant. This is due to the randomness generator my team and I implemented that, while fully taking into account the character attribute points the user puts in, will always leave open a chance for the failure of a given choice (or in likewise fashion, its success).
